                <h2>About color screens.</h2>
                <p>This project is a collection of layouts, displaying basic concepts of programming.
                    It may look like really simple components at first glance, but they contain some of
                    the most core concepts of Javascript. For example, the note taking component displayed 
                    in the note screen, actually includes some really neat dynamic behaviour. As it needs
                    to be dynamic for the different actions it has, such as adding, removing and completing 
                    notes. I hope these slides will prove as useful inspiration for what really basic Javascript
                    can do.</p>

                    Javascript has the ability to get hours, minutes and seconds without an API, wow!</p>

                   <p>To retrive weather data we actually need to call upon an API godess.
                       But have no fear! There are lot's of maintainable weather API's out there.
                       Happy coding!
